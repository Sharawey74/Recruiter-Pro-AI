EXPLANATION: Why You're Getting the Same Results
=================================================

1. THE 3 JOBS ARE FIXED (BY DESIGN)
   - This system ONLY has 3 canonical jobs
   - Located at: data/json/jobs_canonical.json
   - These 3 jobs are:
     * Digital Artist / Concept Artist
     * Team Lead Analytics  
     * Mean Stack/full Stack Web Developer
   
   ✅ This is CORRECT behavior - we designed it this way!

2. THE MATCHING IS WORKING CORRECTLY
   - Your resume was matched against all 3 jobs
   - The system scored each job based on:
     * Skills overlap (60% weight)
     * Experience match (25% weight)
     * Education (10% weight)
     * Keywords (5% weight)
   
   ✅ The ranking you see (MEAN Stack > Artist > Analytics) is correct!

3. THE PROBLEM: EXPERIENCE EXTRACTION
   - Your resume shows: "experience_years: 0"
   - This affects the scoring!
   - Possible reasons:
     a) Your PDF/DOCX has broken formatting
     b) Experience is written in an unusual format
     c) No explicit "X years of experience" statement

4. WHAT TO CHECK:
   - Upload your resume again
   - Click the "View Extracted Text" debug expander
   - Look for how experience is written in the raw text
   - Does it say "5 years" or "2019-2024" or similar?

5. EXPERIENCE PATTERNS WE DETECT:
   ✓ "5 years of experience"
   ✓ "5+ years experience"  
   ✓ "Experience: 5 years"
   ✓ "5 yrs in software"
   ✓ Date ranges: "2019-2024" or "2019-Present"
   
   ✗ We DON'T extract from job titles like "Senior (5+ years)"
   ✗ We DON'T count individual job durations automatically

6. TO FIX YOUR RESULTS:
   Option A: Add explicit text to your resume:
            "Total Experience: X years"
   
   Option B: Use the "Paste Resume" tab with properly formatted text
   
   Option C: Check the extracted text debug view to see what we're reading

7. ABOUT THE "SAME RESULTS":
   - Different resumes WILL get different scores
   - But ALL resumes match against the SAME 3 jobs
   - The system is deterministic - same input = same output
   - If you upload the SAME resume twice, you SHOULD get identical results!

TEST YOURSELF:
- Try pasting this text in "Paste Resume" tab:

"John Smith
Email: john@example.com
Phone: 555-1234

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Senior Software Engineer with 8 years of experience.

SKILLS
Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, AWS

EXPERIENCE
8 years in full stack development"

- You should see different scores compared to your current resume!

==============================================================
CONCLUSION: The system is working correctly. The issue is:
1. You only have 3 canonical jobs (by design)
2. Your resume's experience extraction may need formatting help
